# OVS

Soon :)

## Installing OVS Plugin

This plugin is currently in beta. It is therefore not available in Obsidian's official plugin store.
However, you can install it using [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/brat-quick-guide) (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool).

To install the OVS plugin (`chhoumann/ovs`) using BRAT:

1. Install BRAT from Obsidian's Community Plugins.
2. Open the command palette and run `BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing`.
3. Enter `chhoumann/ovs` when prompted for the repository.
4. Click "Add Plugin" and wait for BRAT to confirm installation.
5. Go to Settings > Community plugins.
6. Refresh the plugin list.
7. Find "OVS" and enable it.

To update the plugin later, use the command `BRAT: Check for updates to all beta plugins and UPDATE`.
