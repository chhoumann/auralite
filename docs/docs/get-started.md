# Get started

This guide will help you install and set up Auralite.

## Installation

There are two ways to install Auralite:

### Option 1: Install via BRAT (Recommended)

1. Install [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/brat-quick-guide) (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool) from Obsidian's Community Plugins.
2. Open the command palette and run `BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing`.
3. Enter `chhoumann/auralite` when prompted for the repository.
4. Click "Add Plugin" and wait for BRAT to confirm installation.
5. Go to Settings > Community plugins.
6. Refresh the plugin list.
7. Find "Auralite" and enable it.

To update the plugin later, use the command `BRAT: Check for updates to all beta plugins and UPDATE`.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

For those who prefer manual installation, a beta-beta version is available.

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/chhoumann/auralite/releases). You should download the `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `styles.css` files.
    1. You can also download the beta version, noted by `-beta.x` in the release name. Beta releases are not guaranteed to be stable, but have the latest features.
2. Move the files into your Obsidian vault's plugins folder, in a designated folder for the plugin. If you call the folder `auralite`, the files should be in `<your_vault>/.obsidian/plugins/auralite/`.
3. Go to Settings > Community plugins.
4. Refresh the plugin list.
5. Find `Auralite` and enable it.

Note: With manual installation, you'll need to repeat these steps to update the plugin when new versions are released.
Either restart Obsidian, or enable and disable the plugin to update it, after downloading the new version.


## Initial Setup

After installation, follow these steps to get started:

1. Open Obsidian Settings.
2. Navigate to the Auralite plugin settings.
3. Enter your OpenAI API key in the designated field.

## Basic Usage

While detailed usage instructions are still in development, here are some key features:

- Create new notes using voice commands
- Transcribe your speech (with formatting)
- Write directly to the current note using voice input
